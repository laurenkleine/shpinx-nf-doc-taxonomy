Project Summary
===============


The Stenglein Lab Standard Taxonomic Assessment Pipeline taxonomically assigns reads in a NGS dataset that remain after filtering host sequences.

This pipeline uses `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io/>`_, a bioinformatics domain specific language for workflow building. Software dependencies are handled using `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ – a container technology which offers excellent accessibility and reproducibility.
